# ML-Project-Code

All of the required imports and packages are in the beginning of each file.

Each file can be run independently. The required dataset is created at the start of the file.

Some files require commenting/uncommenting for different parts. It should be fairly obvious when this is required.

Naming convention should be self-explanatory. Comparison covers the final analysis and exports some of the data to excel where I created the charts and tables (this is found in the "Results Presented" excel file).  The other files cover the algorithms and parameter tuning individually for both datasets.

Also the neural network accuracy vs iteration curves is contained in 2 separate files (NN_LC & NN_LC_ds2)
